# 📱 FitTrack (Mockup Capstone Project)

This repository contains the **mockup prototype** for my Mobile Development Capstone project.  
The app is called **FitTrack**, and its goal is to help users **track workouts, habits, and daily fitness progress**.  

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

FitTrack is designed to be a **fitness and habit tracker** where users can:

- Log workouts with type, duration, and optional notes
- Track daily habits (e.g., Water intake, Meditation, Steps)
- View a history of their logged activities
- Eventually visualize progress through simple stats/charts

⚠️ **Note:**  
This is an **initial mockup** submission. The current version focuses on:
- Basic app navigation
- Simple log form for workouts
- Prototype tab bar (Log, History, Habits, Stats)
- Local-only data (no database yet)

More advanced functionality will be added as the capstone progresses.
